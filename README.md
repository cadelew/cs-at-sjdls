IN PROGRESS...

I aim to create a website that can be used as a resource for students interested in computer science at SJDLS. This will include resourcse for passing the AP computer science exam such  as study guides, project checklists, and documentation links. I also plan to include high school programs such as Google's CSSI and Jane Street's AMP.
